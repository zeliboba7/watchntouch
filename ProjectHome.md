Watch & Touch is aimed to be a complete, free & open source, multi-platform, interactive whiteboard system which supports multi-touch gestures, complemented by an in-classroom collaborative working client to increase student participation in classroom activities.

The project will be developed using Qt with C++ and actively tested on Windows XP and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
